## Source Code and Dataset

To run the code simply execute `main.m`

**Datasets:** 
The [`Benchmarks`](Benchmarks/) folder contains three financial time series datasets used for testing and evaluating the code.

+ `HSI_Index.mat` corresponds to the Hang Seng Index (HSI) time series.
+ `SSE_Index.mat` corresponds to the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) time series.
+ `SandP_Index.mat` corresponds to the Standard & Poor's Index (SPX) time series.
